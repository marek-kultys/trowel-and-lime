# Sgraffito is a unique way to create interior or exterior walls as works of art.

# Our offer
We work with architecture and interior design studios, as well as with individual clients. We offer both the design and production of sgraffitos, but we can also work with clients' own ideas. Every sgraffito project is unique because everyone's needs, ideas, and spaces are different. That's why every sgraffito is priced individually based on your location, size and shape of the wall, materials and designs used, as well as the scheduling of works. Please get in touch for more details.

# What is sgraffito?
Sgraffito is a technique of wall art and decoration where depictions are made by applying and removing layers of coloured plaster. Sgraffito is known to have been used since the classical antiquity. It was revived and popularised in Italy during the Renaissance. The word "sgraffito" comes from the Italian "graffiare" which means "to scratch". This in turn comes from the Greek γράφειν (gráphein) — that is "to write". Sgraffito is thus the art of scratching.

# How does it work?
Sgraffito is applied onto bare masonry or concrete walls. We prepare plasters on site, adding and mixing chosen pigments with you to obtain desired colours in selected light conditions. Then plaster is applied onto walls in layers of different colour. Finally, once the design is transferred onto the wall, parts of plaster are removed to expose underneath layers and produce the designed image.

# Sgraffito examples
Here are some examples of previous sgraffitos done in residential spaces.
