                     During the on-site visit, we'll explain the process of creating sgraffito in detail, show and discuss examples of previous work, and inspect the site where the mural is planned. We might also have some initial sketches for you to review if you had already decided about the theme or style for your sgraffito.

                  <p>
                     After this, we'll prepare a proposal including a range of original sgraffito projects for you to select from, a detailed project plan, an itemised list of works, and the project budget. We'll iterate on sgraffito designs and proposal details until you are happy and ready to start the works.

                  <p>
                     Depending on the size and complexity of your space as well as the sgraffito, the works can take between a few days to several weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     We begin the works by preparing the space and ordering materials. If you wish to use special pigments, we'll select colours together and prepare samples that'll give you a feel for what the sgraffito would look like in different lighting conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Next, we'll prepare full-sized stencils based on the original design that will give you an impression of the scale of the sgraffito. We'll divide the stencil into sections and apply plaster in stages, one section after another.

                     Once all sections are done, we'll focus on finishing work: adding texture and colour details to selected places, and integrating the sgraffito with its immediate surrounding.

                     When the work is finished, we'll together once again inspect the sgraffito in detail. We'll discuss and agree on any follow-up work. It's a good idea to inspect the work after several weeks as well to see how the materials are binding and if anything needs further attention.

                  <p>
                     At the end of the project, we'll share a summary of works, documenting materials and techniques used in your project, as well as detailed care instructions for your sgraffito.
